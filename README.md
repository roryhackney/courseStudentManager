# courseStudentManager
This project involved learning to use Java interfaces, classes, multidimensional arrays, file processing with Scanner, and unit tests with JUnit. The goal of the project was to take separate student and course CSV files and process them in order to find student information for each course.

I wrote the Java code using Scanner to read the files, line by line filling in a two dimensional array of Student objects and one dimensional array of String course names.

Once that was done, I implemented various methods in order to provide access to the data without exposing the private fields. I also handled unit testing using JUnit to ensure the methods worked as expected.

When you run Main.main(), the output shows the first and last student alphabetically, the total number of students and classes, and the attendance list for one specific class.
